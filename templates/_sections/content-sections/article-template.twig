In practice, most people borrow at the wrong times and on the wrong terms, in order to buy the wrong things at the wrong times for all the wrong reasons. The loan reduces the investment gain (if there is one) and increases the amount of the investment loss (if there is one).'

        body: 'All short-term trading is speculation, in that fundamental values do not change quickly. An investor is always interested in long-term improvements in earnings, cash flows and dividends. A trader is interested in quick changes in price and is therefore always a speculator. Futures, call options and all future contracts are speculation rather than investments because their ending value after expiration is zero.'

Twelve years later, this person owns a hodgepodge of 12 mutual funds, because—like Miss Universe—nobody wins twice. This will result in an expensive index fund with gaps, redundancies, and fee inefficiencies.'

    {
        heading: 'Under Diversification',
        body: 'The fatal narrowing of a portfolio down to essentially one idea. Holding the preponderance of your equity "portfolio" in one stock is not investing. It is Russian roulette. Every day when the market opens, you point that gun at your head and pull the trigger in what economists call "creative destruction."'
